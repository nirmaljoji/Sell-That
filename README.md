# Project Title: SellThat

## Overview

SellThat is a web application designed to facilitate the exchange of educational materials among college students. Upon completing a semester, students often possess surplus materials like textbooks, drafting tools, geometry boxes, Arduino boards, motors, etc., which they may no longer need. SellThat aims to connect these students with others in need of such materials, thereby bridging the gap between sellers and buyers within the college community. By providing a platform for direct communication between sellers and buyers, SellThat makes the process of passing on materials hassle-free and efficient.

## Features

- **Product Listings:** Students can list advertisements for materials they wish to sell or request products they need.
- **College Forum:** A forum is provided for students within the same college to interact freely, facilitating communication between juniors and seniors for questions and queries.
- **Lost and Found:** A section is dedicated to lost and found items, enabling students to report lost items or return found items to their owners.
